# CrewSUMMIT API Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the CrewSUMMIT API, which serves as the bridge between the frontend application and the CrewAI framework implementation.

## Introduction

The CrewSUMMIT API provides:

1. RESTful endpoints for managing agents, crews, flows, and tasks
2. Data conversion between frontend models and CrewAI objects
3. State persistence and synchronization
4. Real-time updates for monitoring crew operations

## Architecture

![API Architecture](../../public/placeholder.svg)

The API follows a clean architecture with:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and CrewAI integration
- **Repository Layer**: Manages data persistence
- **Model Layer**: Defines data structures

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, high-performance web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **SQLAlchemy** (optional): ORM for database interactions
- **WebSockets**: For real-time updates
- **CrewAI**: Core framework for AI agent orchestration
