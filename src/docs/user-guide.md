# CrewSUMMIT User Guide

This comprehensive user guide covers all aspects of using CrewSUMMIT to manage AI agent crews.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides an overview of your system with the following components:

- **Quick Stats**: Summary of active crews, agents, and tasks
- **Recent Activity**: Timeline of recent events and task completions

- **Navigation**: Access to all main sections of the application

## Managing Agents

### Agent Overview

Agents are the individual AI entities that perform tasks within your crews. Each agent has:

- **Identity**: Name and description
- **Role**: Specialized function within a crew
- **Model**: The underlying AI model
- **Tools**: Capabilities and integrations available to the agent
- **History**: Record of tasks and performance

### Creating Agents

1. Navigate to Agents > Create New Agent
2. Complete the agent form:
   - **Name**: A unique, descriptive name
   - **Role**: Select from researcher, writer, analyst, designer, developer, reviewer, or custom
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the agent's purpose
   - **LLM**: Select the language model (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - **Tools**: Add capabilities like web search, code execution, data analysis
   - **Memory**: Configure how the agent retains information

3. Advanced Settings (optional):
   - **Temperature**: Controls creativity vs. precision (0-1)
   - **Context Window**: Maximum tokens for context
   - **Response Format**: Structure for agent outputs
   - **Constraints**: Limitations on agent actions

4. Click "Create Agent"

### Managing Existing Agents

- **View**: Select an agent from the list to see details
- **Edit**: Modify agent settings and capabilities
- **Duplicate**: Create a copy with similar settings
- **Delete**: Remove an agent (disabled if part of active crews)
- **Performance**: View metrics on agent effectiveness

## Building and Managing Crews

### Crew Overview

Crews are collections of agents organized to accomplish tasks through collaboration.

### Creating a Crew

   - Arrange in order of execution (for sequential processing)
   - Define agent relationships and communication patterns
   
4. Configure execution settings:
   - **Task Execution Strategy**: Sequential or Parallel
   - **Max Iterations**: Limit for task attempts
   - **Verbose Mode**: Enable detailed logging
   
5. Click "Create Crew"

### Managing Crews

- **View**: See crew details, composition, and history
- **Edit**: Modify crew settings and membership
- **Run**: Execute the crew on a task
- **Monitor**: Track crew performance and task progress
- **Archive**: Store inactive crews for future reference

## Task Management

### Creating Tasks

1. Navigate to Tasks > Create New Task
2. Define the task:
   - **Description**: Clear instructions for what to accomplish
   - **Assigned To**: Specific agent or entire crew
   - **Priority**: Importance level
   - **Deadline**: Completion timeframe (optional)
   
3. Add additional information:
   - **Context**: Background information
   - **Resources**: Links or files
   - **Success Criteria**: How to evaluate completion
   
4. Click "Create Task"

### Task Monitoring

- **Status**: Track progress (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed)
- **Details**: View specific actions taken
- **Output**: Review task results
- **Timeline**: See execution history

## Flow Management

Flows provide a visual representation of task execution through your crews.

### Creating a Flow

1. Navigate to Flows > Create New Flow
2. Design your workflow:
   - Add nodes for tasks, conditions, loops, and approvals
   - Connect nodes with directional edges
   - Configure node parameters and conditions
   
3. Assign crews or agents to specific nodes
4. Save and validate your flow

### Running Flows

1. Select a flow from the Flows dashboard
2. Click "Run Flow"
3. Monitor execution in real-time
4. Respond to approval requests or human-in-the-loop prompts
5. Review results upon completion

### Flow Templates

The system provides several pre-configured flow templates:

- **Sequential Processing**: Linear task execution
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous task execution
- **Review-and-Approve**: Includes human approval steps
- **Iterative Refinement**: Looping with improvement cycles
- **Conditional Branching**: Decision-based paths

## Settings and Configuration

### AI Provider Settings

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Providers
2. Configure your LLM providers:
   - Add API keys
   - Set default models
   - Configure rate limits and fallbacks
   
### User Preferences

- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode
- **Dashboard Layout**: Customize your view
- **Notifications**: Configure alerts for crew activities
- **Data Storage**: Local or external options

## Data Management

### Import/Export

- **Agents**: Share agent configurations across instances
- **Crews**: Export crew structures for reuse
- **Flows**: Save and load flow templates
- **Tasks**: Batch import task definitions

### Backup and Restore

- **Manual Backup**: Create on-demand backup files
- **Scheduled Backup**: Configure automatic backups
- **Restore**: Recover from previous backup points

## Advanced Features

### Human-in-the-Loop Integration

Configure points in your flows where human input or approval is required:

1. Add a human approval node to your flow
2. Configure notification settings
3. Define timeout actions
4. Specify required approval roles

### Custom AI Provider Integration

For advanced users who need to connect to custom AI providers:

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Providers > Add Custom
2. Configure:
   - API endpoint
   - Authentication method
   - Request/response format
   - Model parameters

### Resource Monitoring

Track system resource usage:
